# Andover Housing

This website was made by a group at [the Workshop](https://tanginstitute.andover.edu/ourwork/school-within-a-school) to report on trends on housing in Phillips Academy, a New England boarding school.

## Technical details

Made with only bare-bones HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The only significant dependency is d3. There's only one webpage too. Fonts included. Everything is mashed into ``index.html``, ``index.css``, ``index.html`` as you expect.

Hosted using GitHub pages, viewable here: [https://califynic.github.io/andover-housing/](https://califynic.github.io/andover-housing/)

Not really made for mobile devices.

``fixer.py`` and ``toc.py`` are for maintainer's own use to generate table of contents and to remove any special characters from the HTML.

**Warning: lots of spaghetticode. Enter at your own risk.**
